# Custard Music
Custard music is a custom version of [https://github.com/Androz2091/discord-player/tree/v4.1.0](discord-player v4.1.0) that removes youtube support so it can be used with custard along side premium. Feel free to use this repo if you want, however it's not recommended since it's an out of date version of discord-player.

#### Disclaimer
I didn't make this. Androz2091 did. I'm simply editing it so I don't get ceased and decist by google.
